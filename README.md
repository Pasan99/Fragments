# Fragments
A Fragment is a self-contained component with its own user interface (UI) and lifecycle that can be reused in different parts of an app's UI.Fragment reperesent a behaviour or a portion of user interface in a FragmentActivity. Combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build multi pane ui and reuse fragments is multiple activities. Fragments has its own lifecycle. Fragments must always be hosted in an activity and it's lifecyle is directly affected by the activity's lifecycle. 

There is two ways of adding fragment to an activity
 1. Adding Fragments Dynamically
 2. Adding Fragments statically (Remain on the screen during the entire lifecyle of an activity)

Ex : `DatePicker` object (Dynamic Fragment), which is an isnstance of `DialogFagment`, a subclass of `Fragment`

 Fragment can retain an instance of its data after a configuration change (such as changing the orientation). This feature makes a Fragment useful as a UI component, as compared to using separate Views. While an Activity is destroyed and recreated when a device's configuration changes, a Fragment is not destroyed.

<h4>Adding Fragments statically</h4>
First, you need to create a fragment. (Use android studio's pre build templates). To create a blank Fragment, expand app > java in Project: Android view, select the folder containing the Java code for your app, and choose `File > New > Fragment > Fragment (Blank)`. Give a name to the fragment (Ex:MessageFragment). Add the following XML code to the activity's layout file where you want to add the fragment.


```XML
<fragment
        android:layout_width="0dp"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:name="com.example.fragments.MessageFragment"
        tools:layout="@layout/fragment_message"
        android:layout_margin="2dp"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />
```

<h4>Adding Fragments Dynamically</h4>
We need to use FragmentTransaction to add, remove or replace Fragment from an activity.

The best practice for instantiating the Fragment in the Activity is to provide a `newinstance()` factory method in the Fragment. Follow these steps to add the `newinstance()` method to Fragment and instantiate the Fragment in Activity. You will also add the `displayFragment()` and `closeFragment()` methods, and use Fragment transactions

 1. Open Fragment, and add the following method for instantiating and returning the Fragment to the Activity:
 ```kotlin
 companion object{
        fun newInstance() : RateFragment{
            return RateFragment()
        }
    }
```
 2. Open Activity, and create the following `displayRatingFragment()` method to instantiate and open `RateFragment`. It starts by creating an instance of `RateFragment` by calling the `newInstance()` method in `RateFragment`:
```kotlin
private fun displayRatingFragment(){
        val rateFragment = RateFragment.newInstance()
        val fragmentTransaction = supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
        fragmentTransaction.add(R.id.fragment_container, rateFragment)
            .addToBackStack(null)
            .commit()
        isRatingFragmentDisplayed = true
        
        // Set the listener created in Fragment
        rateFragment.setOnCloseListener(object : RateFragment.OnCloseListener{
            @SuppressLint("SetTextI18n")
            override fun onRated(rating: Float) {
                rate_result.visibility = View.VISIBLE
                rate_result.text = "$rating â˜…"
            }

            override fun onClose(button: Button) {
                closeRatingFragment()
            }

        })
 }
 private fun closeRatingFragment(){
        val rateFragment = supportFragmentManager.findFragmentById(R.id.fragment_container)
        if (rateFragment != null){
            val fragmentTransaction = supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
            fragmentTransaction.remove(rateFragment).commit()
            isRatingFragmentDisplayed = false
        }
 }
 ```
Using `supportFragmentManager`, use `beginTransaction()` to get an instance of `FragmentTransaction`. `FragmentTransaction` can be used to add a new fragment. I add `OnCloseListener` (Interface was created in `RateFragment`) to identify the user interactions on `RateFragment`.

<h5>RateFragment</h5>

```kotlin
class RateFragment : Fragment() {

    private lateinit var closeListener : OnCloseListener

    companion object{
        fun newInstance() : RateFragment{
            return RateFragment()
        }
    }

    fun setOnCloseListener(listener: OnCloseListener){
        this.closeListener = listener
    }

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        // Inflate the layout for this fragment
        val view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_rate, container, false)
        val closeBtn = view.findViewById<Button>(R.id.close_btn)
        val ratingBar = view.findViewById<RatingBar>(R.id.ratingBar)
        closeBtn.setOnClickListener {
            closeListener.onClose(it as Button)
        }
        ratingBar.setOnRatingBarChangeListener { _, rating, _ ->
            closeListener.onRated(rating)
        }
        return view
    }

    interface OnCloseListener{
        fun onClose(button: Button)
        fun onRated(rating: Float)
    }

}
```

With FragmentManager your code can perform the following Fragment transactions while the app runs, using FragmentTransaction methods: 
- Add a Fragment using add().
- Remove a Fragment using remove().
- Replace a Fragment with another Fragment using replace().
 
There are also a few subclasses that you might want to extend, instead of the base Fragment class:

<h5>DialogFragment</h5>
Displays a floating dialog. Using this class to create a dialog is a good alternative to using the dialog helper methods in the Activity class, because you can incorporate a fragment dialog into the back stack of fragments managed by the activity, allowing the user to return to a dismissed fragment.

<h5>ListFragment</h5>
Displays a list of items that are managed by an adapter (such as a SimpleCursorAdapter), similar to ListActivity. It provides several methods for managing a list view, such as the onListItemClick() callback to handle click events. (Note that the preferred method for displaying a list is to use RecyclerView instead of ListView. In this case you would need to create a fragment that includes a RecyclerView in its layout. See Create a List with RecyclerView to learn how.)

<h5>PreferenceFragmentCompat</h5>
Displays a hierarchy of Preference objects as a list. This is used to create a settings screen for your application.

Tip: For each fragment transaction, you can apply a transition animation, by calling setTransition() before you commit.
